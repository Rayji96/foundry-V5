This system is for playing multiple World of Darkness 5th edition systems on the Foundry Virtual Tabletop System.

Licensed WoD 5e materials will NOT be provided as this is a system provided for public use for free. We have made every effort to keep the Dark Pack guidelines as posted at [Dark Pact License].

## Dice

There is integration with Dice So Nice!

To roll regular Vampire dice, roll `1dv`. To roll Hunger dice, roll `1dg`. Replace the 1s with however many dice you want to roll for each type.

To roll regular Hunter dice, roll `1dh`. To roll Desperation dice, roll `1ds`. Replace the 1s with however many dice you want to roll for each type.
