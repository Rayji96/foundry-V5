This system is for playing Vampire the Masquerade 5th edition on the Foundry Virtual Tabletop System.

Licensed VtM5e materials will NOT be provided (list of disciplines, clans, etc.) as this is a system provided for public use for free.

There is integration with Dice So Nice! To roll regular vampire dice, roll `1dv`. To roll Hunger dice, roll `1dh`. Replace the 1s with however many dice you want to roll for each type.
