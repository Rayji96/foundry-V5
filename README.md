## Dice

The system has integration with Dice So Nice!

The information for how to roll the splat-unique dice is like so:
* To roll Vampire dice, roll `1dv`. To roll Hunger dice, roll `1dg`.
* To roll Hunter dice, roll `1dh`. To roll Desperation dice, roll `1ds`.
* To roll Werewolf dice, roll `1dw`. To roll Rage dice, roll `1dr`.

Replace the 1s with however many you want to roll for each type, and let the dice roll!
